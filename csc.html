                for example 55 or Malik respectively. There are three types of
                data - Numeric, alphabetic, and alphanumeric. Numeric data
                consists of digits 0 - 9 (e. g. 31), while alphabetic data
                consist of any of the English language alphabets (e. g. Toyin).
                An alphanumeric data can consist of a number, an alphabet or a
                special character, such as a vehicle plate number (e. g. AE 731

                transformation process involves a series of operations to be
                performed by the computer on the raw data that are fed into it.
                The operation can be arithmetic (such as addition, subtraction,
                multiplication, and division), logical comparison or character

                    1940's and last till 1950's. The first generation computers
                    were characterized with the use of vacuum tubes as its major
                    components. These vacuum tubes generate enormous heat and
                    consume much electricity. The first generation computers
                    introduce the concept of stored programs. Exclusively,
                    computer experts can program the computer only in machine

                    These were the set of computers that succeeded the first
                    generation computers. Their advent was in early 1950's and
                    the lasted until late 1950's.the components of the second
                    generation of computer were built around transistors which
                    replaces the vacuum tube in the first generation. The
                    resultant effect of the transistors in place of vacuum tube
                    is reduction in size compare with first generation
                    computers, less power consumption, generation of less heat
                    and improved storage facility due to introduction of
                    magnetic devices for storage medium. The overall effects are
                    the improved reliability and introduction of symbolic
                    languages for programming. Examples are ATLAS, IBM 1400
                    series, PDP I & II etc.

                    <span class="d__title">Third Generation Computer</span>:
                    This generation of computer succeeded the second generation
                    computers. The advent of this generation was between early
                    1960's to late 1960's. Due to the technological advancement
                    that has taken place in the industrial sector which makes
                    many transistors to be coupled into a single unit component.
                    Hence, the major component that characterized the third
                    generation computer is the Integrated Circuitry (IC), which
                    is a resultant effect of thousands of transistors combined
                    into a single unit component. The integration of transistors
                    into one component makes the computer smaller in size
                    compare with first and second generation computers, faster
                    machine, consume less power and generate less heat. The
                    concept of multi-programming was introduced in this
                    generation of computer. Programming was made easier by the
                    use of high level languages. Examples include: IBM 360/370
                    series, ICL 1900 series etc.

                    <span class="d__title">fourth Generation Computer</span>:
                    The emphasis in the first three generations of computer has
                    been on the development of a computer system that is less
                    expensive, more portable and highly reliable. The fourth
                    generation computers were also developed having in mind the
                    above assertions. These generations of computers were built
                    around Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuitry (VLSI) in which
                    over ten thousand flip-flops were placed in a single silicon
                    chip i.e thousands of ICs were combined into a single chip.
                    These period witness the era of microcomputer with the
                    introduction of microprocessors as its major component. The
                    system came into being in the early 1970's and still in
                    existence till date. Examples include: IBM, COMPAQ 2000
                    series, Dell series, Toshiba etc.

                    1980's and classical researches are still going on in this

                    to actualize the reasons for this generation of computer.
                    The objective of this computer system is to build a computer
                    system that mimic the intelligence of human expert in a
                    knowledge domain such as medicine, law, education, criminal

                     These types of computers combine the

                    data in both discrete quantity and variable quantities. They
                    are mostly found in industrial processes for data
                    acquisition and data processing purposes. In most cases,
                    analogue signal generated from the analogue computer needs
                    to be converted to digital signal which has to be processed
                    by the digital computer, hence, the need for
                    Analogue-to-Digital Converter modulator/demodulator (Modem).
